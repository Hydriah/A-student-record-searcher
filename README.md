# A-student-record-searcher
An array named 'students' contains a list of students records.
@objecttask1report.js the code asks the user to search for any student on the register by typing its fullname.
On entering the name the students records is expected to display.
But!! after efforts trying i havn't been able to acheive that!!
Instead, for the student's record to display i would hav do this;
Type i.e  "obinna ikeh"
Click " OK" button
Then click the 'CANCEL' button.
This is a LIMITATION !!!,,,,hence i need contributors to make this code function RIGHT!
Thanks in anticipation!
